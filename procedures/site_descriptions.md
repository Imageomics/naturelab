# Site Descriptions

Sites are numbers in chronological order in which the camera traps and then song meters were installed. The site descriptions include the location, habitat type, and any notable features or wildlife activity observed during the deployment. Camera trap sites were selected based on high deer activity observed in the area, particularly around the lakes. Where possible, we used existing structures like Nomad Shelters or Zipline Towers to mount the camera traps where the sensors would be protected from the elements and wildlife interference.

Note: GPS recordings from Garmin GPS, GPS coordinates recorded in Jotform are from iPhone Apple Maps.
