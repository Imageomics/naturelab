# Field Collection Protocol Overview

## Pre-deployment Preparation
   - Review and understand all field collection protocols.
   - Ensure all equipment is packed and in working order.
   - Charge all batteries and pack spares.
   - Format SD cards and label them with unique IDs.
   - Access Jotform for data entry, with a paper backup.
   - Confirm team roles and responsibilities.

## Site Identification and Mapping
### Location Selection
- Use GPS to identify and mark locations for camera traps and bioacoustic sensors.
- Ensure locations cover diverse habitats and wildlife corridors.
- Create a map of the field site with marked locations for each team.

### Site Location Log
Maintain a log with the following details for each site:
- Site ID
- Descriptive name
- GPS coordinates
- Habitat description
- Access notes
- Deployment history

### Naming Conventions
   - **Site ID:** Use a consistent format (e.g., "TW-001" for The Wilds site 1).
   - **Camera Trap ID:** Combine site ID with camera number (e.g., "TW-001-CT01").
   - **Bioacoustic Sensor ID:** Combine site ID with sensor number (e.g., "TW-001-BS01").
   - **SD Card ID:** Use a unique identifier for each SD card (e.g., "SD001", "SD002").
   - **Date Format:** Use YYYYMMDD for all date entries (e.g., 20240615 for June 15, 2024).
    - **Time Format:** Use 24-hour format (e.g., 1430 for 2:30 PM).

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
Work in pairs, one person handling setup and maintenance, the other documenting data. Rotate roles as needed.

**Team Lead:** Oversees the entire field operation, ensures protocols are followed, and manages communication with external parties.
   
**Data Manager:** Responsible for data collection, entry into Jotform, and ensuring data integrity.

---
   
**Camera Trap Set Up:** Handles the deployment, maintenance, and retrieval of camera traps.
   
**Camera Trap Documenter:** Records all relevant information about camera trap deployments and maintenance in Jotform or field notebook.

---

**Bioacoustic Sensor Set Up:** Manages the deployment, maintenance, and retrieval of bioacoustic sensors.

**Bioacoustic Sensor Documenter:** Records all relevant information about bioacoustic sensor deployments and maintenance in Jotform or field notebook.

---

**Lead Pilot (if drones are used):** Responsible for the safe operation of the drone, including pre-flight checks and flight execution.

**Pilot Assistant:** Assists the Lead Pilot with situational awareness, including monitoring airspace, ground conditions, and wildlife. Handles communication between the Lead Pilot and third parties.
 
 **Ground Crew:** Assists with equipment setup, packing, and other logistical tasks, and ensures the safety of the operational area by monitoring for ground obstacles and wildlife.

## Assign Locations to Each Crew
- Divide the field site into zones, assigning each team to specific areas for camera traps and bioacoustic sensors.
- Ensure each team has a map and GPS coordinates for their assigned locations.
- Rotate teams between zones as needed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the field site.
- Determine rally points and times for teams to regroup and share data.

## Field Safety & Best Practices

- Always inform supervisor of field schedule and expected return
- Carry communication device (cell phone/radio)
- Work in pairs when possible
- Be aware of wildlife activity and seasonal considerations
- Follow all Wilds safety protocols and vehicle operation procedures
- Weather monitoring - avoid deployments during severe weather
- Respect all facility rules regarding animal enclosures and restricted areas

### In the event of an emergency
- Follow established emergency protocols.
- Ensure all team members are accounted for and safe.
- Contact emergency services if necessary.
- Document the incident and report it to the Team Lead.

## Post-Fieldwork
- Refer to the Data Transfer & Storage instructions for detailed steps.
- Back up all data to OSC using Globus or rsync.
- Ensure all equipment is cleaned, checked for damage, and stored properly.
- Conduct a debrief with the team to discuss what went well and what could be improved for future fieldwork.
- Complete any remaining data entry and ensure all records are accurate and complete.
- Prepare a summary report of the fieldwork activities and findings.
