#  Bioacoustic Data Collection Protocol
*Adapted from fieldwork protocols developed by the Koa team for the 2025 Experiential Introduction to AI and Biodiversity course, in collaboration with NEON, ABC Center, and Imageomics.*

## Pre-deployment Preparation
- Format SD cards in camera traps before deployment
- Label SD cards and camera traps with unique IDs
- Charge batteries and pack spares
- Access Jotform for data entry: [Bioacoustic Data Form](https://form.jotform.com/251745612766160), with a paper backup


## Field Protocol Overview

**Equipment per deployment:**
- Song Meter bioacoustic sensors with paired SD cards
- Zip ties for mounting to fence posts and trees
- Field notebook and pencil


## Site Setup

### Site Selection
   - Place Sound Meters to capture diverse acoustic environments 
   - Mount at eye-level (approximately 5 feet) on fence posts or trees using zip ties
   - Ensure microphone points away from prevailing wind direction
   - Avoid areas with excessive mechanical noise (roads, equipment)


### Configuration
   - Check batteries and micro SD card inserted
   - Slide the **ON/OFF** switch to **ON**
   - Open the Song Meter Config app on your device
   - Press and hold the **PAIR/STATUS** button for 3 seconds. The Bluetooth LED will blink green, indicating the recorder is ready to pair with the app. In the Song Meter Configurator app **Recorders** screen, the **Pair** icon will be displayed next to the Song Meter Micro 2.
   - Tap the **Pair** icon. The icon will turn green, indicating successful pairing. A pop-up message will appear asking if you want to set the recorder's time zone to your mobile device's time zone.
   - Tap **Yes**. A pop-up message will appear asking if you want to set the recorder's location to your mobile device's location.
   - Tap **Yes**. Tap the **Configure** icon for the paired Song Meter Micro 2 in the **Recorders** screen. The Configuration Editor screen is displayed.
   - Select a preset recording schedule from the dropdown menu (see table below) and make any desired settings changes.

Refer to Song Meter app for detailed instructions.


   Song Meter ID | Recording Schedule|
   |----------------|-------------------|
   | SM01          | Record birds/frogs 1 hr during sunrise and 1 hr during sunset |
   | SM02          | Record birds/frogs 1 hr during sunrise and 1 hr during sunset  |
   | SM03          | Record birds/frogs 5 minutes every hour 24/7 |
   | SM04          | Record birds/frogs 5 minutes every hour 24/7 |



## Initial Deployment
- Pair with the Song Meter Micro 2 to update its internal clock.
If desired, accept the prompts during pairing to automatically set the recorder's time zone and deployment location to match your mobile device.
- Check the recorder's Status screen. Resolve any SD card error messages you see on the Status screen.
- Unpair from the Song Meter Micro 2.
- Latch the Song Meter Micro 2 shut, making sure the battery tray ribbon or debris does not block the enclosure from sealing.
- Mount and secure the recorder. Tie orange flagging tape to indicate the location of the recording device.
- The Song Meter Micro 2 automatically runs its recording schedule while it is turned on.


## Data Transfer & Storage

1. **Immediate Processing:**
   - Transfer SD card data to secure storage upon return from field
   - Verify file integrity and completeness
   - Update metadata spreadsheets
   - Format SD cards for next deployment

2. **Data Backup:**
   - Maintain multiple copies of all data
   - Follow institutional data management protocols
   - Regular backup verification

3. **Quality Control:**
   - Review sample of images/recordings for equipment function
   - Note any issues with specific Song Meter
   - Schedule maintenance as needed
