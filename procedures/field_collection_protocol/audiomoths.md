# Bioacoustic Data Collection Protocol
*Adapted from fieldwork protocols developed by the Koa team for the 2025 Experiential Introduction to AI and Biodiversity course, in collaboration with NEON, ABC Center, and Imageomics.*

## Pre-deployment Preparation
- Format SD cards in camera traps before deployment
- Label SD cards and camera traps with unique IDs
- Charge batteries and pack spares
- Access Jotform for data entry: [Bioacoustic Data Form](https://form.jotform.com/251745612766160), with a paper backup


## Field Protocol Overview

**Equipment per deployment:**
- AudioMoth bioacoustic sensors with paired SD cards
- GPS unit
- Zip ties for mounting to fence posts and trees
- Field notebook and pencil


## Site Setup

### Site Selection
   - Place AudioMoths to capture diverse acoustic environments
   - Mount at eye-level (approximately 5 feet) on fence posts or trees using zip ties
   - Ensure microphone points away from prevailing wind direction
   - Avoid areas with excessive mechanical noise (roads, equipment)
   - Select sites to mount AudioMoths in same location as camera traps.

### AudioMoth Configuration
   - Set recording schedule based on target species activity patterns
   - Configure portion of monitors to sample rate to record 5 minutes every hour, on the hour.
   - Configure portion of monitors to record 1 hour in the morning and 1 hour in the evening.
   - Test recording function before final deployment
   - Record deployment details in Jotform and field notebook, and back up CSV to OSC.


## AudioMoth SD Card Replacement

**At each AudioMoth location:**
1. Locate AudioMoth using GPS coordinates
2. Turn device off using switch
3. Remove SD card and record:
   - AudioMoth serial number
   - SD card ID
   - Date and time removed
   - Battery voltage (if display available)
4. Insert fresh SD card
5. Turn device on and verify recording status (LED indicators)
6. Record new SD card ID and deployment time


**AudioMoths Checklist**
- Check for water damage in housing
- Verify microphone is unobstructed
- Test battery level
- Ensure secure mounting


## Troubleshooting AudioMoth Issues:
- No recordings: Verify battery, SD card, recording schedule
- Poor audio quality: Check microphone obstruction, gain settings
- Shortened recording periods: Monitor battery drain, temperature effects



## Data Transfer & Storage

1. **Immediate Processing:**
   - Transfer SD card data to secure storage upon return from field
   - Verify file integrity and completeness
   - Update metadata spreadsheets
   - Format SD cards for next deployment

2. **Data Backup:**
   - Maintain multiple copies of all data
   - Follow institutional data management protocols
   - Regular backup verification

3. **Quality Control:**
   - Review sample of images/recordings for equipment function
   - Note any issues with specific cameras or AudioMoths
   - Schedule maintenance as needed
