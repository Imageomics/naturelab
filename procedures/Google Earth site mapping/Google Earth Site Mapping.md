# Google Earth Site Mapping

## Overview

This subdirectory provides reference materials to evaluate GPS accuracy for sensor deployment sites at The Wilds. It supports the broader NatureLab initiative to standardize spatial metadata for bioacoustic monitors, camera traps, and drone surveillance locations.

## Site Mapping Workflow

* Handheld GPS coordinates were recorded at the time of sensor deployment.
* Manual placements were created in Google Earth based on satellite imagery and known landscape features.
* A ruler line was drawn between each GPS point and corresponding manual point to calculate estimated spatial error.

### Naming Conventions

* **Site ID:** `TW0X` (GPS point)
* **Manual Placement:** `TW0X_manual`
* **Error Vector (ruler):** `TW0X_error`

## File Contents

* **The Wilds Google Earth Site Map.kml**
  Google Earth file containing:

  * Handheld GPS points for TW01â€“TW08
  * Manual site placements based on researcher knowledge
  * Ruler vectors estimating positional error between GPS and manual placements

## Purpose

This file supports preliminary error estimation in field-based spatial data collection. The results may inform future refinements to site metadata and guidance for equipment calibration or deployment protocols.

## Data Notes

* GPS data were collected using Garmin GPS devices and/or Apple Maps via Jotform.
* Manual placements reflect the judgment of field researchers using visible terrain, structures, and known site context.
