# NatureLab at The Wilds

*NatureLab: Bridging Digital and Natural Worlds*

Building the future of biodiversity monitoring through multimodal AI and digital ecosystem modeling

---

## Long-Term Vision

### Digital Twin Development
We are developing a comprehensive **digital twin of The Wilds** â€” a 10,000-acre safari park in southeastern Ohio managed by the Columbus Zoo. This digital ecosystem will serve as a powerful tool for conservation planning, enabling researchers and wildlife managers to:

- **Test conservation strategies** in virtual environments before real-world implementation
- **Optimize sensor deployment** for maximum ecological insight with minimal animal disturbance  
- **Predict ecosystem responses** to environmental changes and management decisions
- **Train and validate** AI models for biodiversity monitoring at scale

### Multimodal AI for Biodiversity
Our research aims to advance the field of **multimodal AI for environmental monitoring** by creating datasets and models that can:

- **Synthesize information** across sensor modalities (visual, acoustic, GPS, satellite, environmental)
- **Enable real-time adaptive sampling** that responds to ecological events as they unfold
- **Support autonomous ecosystem monitoring** with minimal human intervention
- **Scale conservation efforts** through AI-assisted wildlife management

### Impact Beyond The Wilds
This work establishes a **replicable framework** for digital twin development in conservation settings worldwide. Our open datasets and methodologies will enable:

- **Global conservation applications** across diverse ecosystems and species
- **Training resources** for the next generation of conservation AI models
- **Collaborative research platform** connecting ecology, computer science, and conservation communities
- **Evidence-based conservation** through data-driven decision making

## Summer 2025 Proof-of-Concept

### Project Scope
This summer represents our **first step** toward the digital twin vision. We're conducting intensive fieldwork to collect a multimodal dataset focused on a 100-acre area used by Pere David's deer and other species at The Wilds.

**Study Area**: Single pasture for proof-of-concept ([View on Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/10GVFBTCYF9KAoQrGtzBVqn38AuPclY2s?usp=sharing))

**Timeline**: 
- **Field Deployment 1**: June 2025  
- **Field Deployment 2**: August 2025

### Sensor Network Deployment

| Sensor Type | Data Collected | Duration | Target Species |
|-------------|----------------|----------|----------------|
| **GPS Ear Tags** | Hourly location + ID | Continuous | Pere David's deer |
| **Quadcopter Drones** | Behavioral videos | 2-3 days, 4 hrs total | Zebras, giraffes, onagers, and phorses |
| **Fixed-Wing Drones** | Aerial photos + LiDAR | Single 2-hour session | Landscape + all species |
| **Camera Traps** | Motion-triggered photos/video | 1 week continuous | All species (exotic + native) |
| **Bioacoustic Monitors** | Continuous audio recording | 1 week continuous | Birds, insects, ungulate vocalizations |
| **Satellite Imagery** | Landscape monitoring | Continuous archive | Vegetation + land use patterns |
| **Weather Station** | Environmental conditions | Continuous | Context for all other data |

### Key Research Questions
This summer's fieldwork will specifically address:

- **Sensor modality strengths**: Which sensors are most effective for tracking land use, animal interactions, and individual identification?
- **Spatial-temporal overlap**: How well do different sensor types capture the same ecological events?
- **Species identification**: Can we reliably identify species through vocalizations alone?
- **Behavioral patterns**: How do animals use space differently throughout the day and season?
- **Environmental influences**: How do weather conditions affect animal behavior and sensor performance?

### Technical Innovation
We're testing the **ICICLE cyber-infrastructure** for autonomous monitoring, including:
- Autonomous drone navigation and adaptive flight planning
- Real-time camera trap image analysis and species detection  
- Edge AI deployment for on-site data processing
- Sensor fusion techniques for multimodal data integration
