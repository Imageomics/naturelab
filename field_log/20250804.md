# Installation Notes - 2025-08-04 (Monday)

## Stop 1: Nomad Ridge Shelter 
- installed 2 camera traps (CT01 and CT02) and 1 acoustic sensor near lake to capture deer activity
- SD01 had 20 GB; SD02 had ~16.5 GB
- cameras configured to capture photos when motion is detected, set to high sensitivity for night time; no video
- sound meter set to record hourly, 15 min every hour to capture ungulate activity and bird calls

TW02-SM04 (installed next to CT01)


## Stop 2: Zebra Shelter
- installed 1 camera trap and 1 acoustic sensor to capture ungulate activity 
- camera configured to capture photos when motion is detected, set to high sensitivity for night time; no video
- site chosen for camera trap since very few animals detected at the giraffe feeder; Zebra shelter does not have trees nearby so less chance for false triggers

TW06-CT04
TW06-SM03 (installed next to CT04)

## Grevy's
- did not install sensor in this pasture, but stopped by to see new foal

## Stop 3: Old Giraffe Feeder (Pasture D)
- drove past this location, herd of phorses and 2 Pere David's deer grazing nearby so lots of animal acitivity; we noted it was odd that the camera trap here did not capture much activity in June

## Stop 4: Lake Trail Gate O
- installed 1 acoustic sensor at the lake trail gate to capture bird calls during sunrise and sunset
TW05-SM06 (installed on gate)

## Stop 5: Lake Trail lakeshore
- installed 1 camera trap to capture animal activity in the water, we collected good data here in June
TW04-CT03

## Stop 6: Fence with vegetation
- installed 1 acoustic sensor on fence with dense vegetation to capture bird calls in different part of the pasture
TW08-SM03 (installed on fence and marked with flagging tape)

## Stop 7: Zipline Tower
- installed 1 acoustic sensor on zipline tower to capture bird calls during sunrise and sunset
TW07-SM02 (installed on zipline tower and marked with flagging tape)
- We heard guests on the zipline tower, this may affect the recordings
- This would be a good location for a camera trap in the future, nice fence to install the sensors and little trees to trigger false positives

## Notes
- no drone flights today
- all equipment functioning properly, no issues
- used Jotform to record installations 

## Next steps:
- Come back on Thurs, check the SD cards
- Two metrics: battery life and data quality (measured by % of photos with animals present)
- Use Bharath's pipeline to quickly process the data in the field and make adjustments if needed
- Need to determine if SD cards need to be swapped or if we can just download the data in the field
