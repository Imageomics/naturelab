# Installation Notes - 2025-08-07 (Thursday)

## Stop 1: Nomad Ridge Shelter
- checked the 2 CTs and 1 acoustic sensor installed on 2025-08-04
- tested megadetector to determine if the cameras captured any animals; discovered CT01 was left on during storage over the weekend, so lots of empty images; deleted those from SD card
- SM04 were easy to check - just needed to connect via phone app. Recorded info with screenshot: 73 recordings, 4.25 GB used, 93% battery life, 5 min every hour
- Deer resting at the banks of the lake, towards the South west end; Moderately windy; Sunny; Barn Swallows flying around. Animals were captured properly by CT facing left
- Not many animals in sight. Sunny, moderately windy; Barn Swallows flying around; We discovered that there were some blank photos because the camera was accidentally left on when in storage. The ones from the field look fine.

## Stop 2: Zipline shelter
- checked SM02, 7.12 GB used, 43 recordings, 76% battery life. record birds/frongs from sunrise to sunst
- installed smart camera trap (CT05) on zipline tower fence pointing down the hill toward the lakes
- Slightly windy; lot of crickets/insects


## Stop 3: Zebra Shelter
- 8 phorses standing in shelter, observed grooming eachother, moderately windy, sunnyÃŸ
- Checked CT04 and SM03 from vehicle
- CT04 looked good, lots of horse activity, couldn't do full check since horses were shaking the vehicle; 16 GB used, need to swap out for the next visit
- SM03 not turned on, so we turned it on and set it to record 5 min every hour; 0 recordings, 0 GB used, 100% battery life

## Grevy's 
stopped by Grevy's herd to see new male foal (born Monday), month old female foal also present; ostriches were very curious and pecking at the vehicle

## Stop 4: Lake Trail Gate O
- SM06 looked good - 12 recordings, 2.06 GB used, 99% battery life; set to record birds/frogs 2 hours around sunrise and sunset
- no time drift observed 

## Stop 5: Lake Trail lakeshore
- sunny, light breeze
- CT03 did not pick up any data, not sure if wasn't turned on or perhaps reset itself? 
- Reset date, photo only, 5 sec delay, side sensors on, pointed toward hillside (lots of deer observed there, would be good for drone flights). battery 66%, replace next time

## To Do for next time:
1. Switch out SD cards on camera traps; check battery levels and replace if needed
2. Update jotforms to capture important information
   - battery life
   - data quality (measured by % of photos with animals present)
   - number of photos with animals >3
   - amount of data on SD card
   - make sure date and time are correct on all devices - CTs seem to reset themselves to the wrong year
3. Update megadetector pipeline to process data in the field (see details below)
4. Confirm team availability to ensure sufficient people for drone flights
5. Ideas for additional camera traps:
    - Install camera trap facing lake near fence corner (maybe take down one at Nomad shelter)
    - Install camera trap on pond dock facing hillside
    - Move CT06, mostly capturing the buses
    - Other zipline tower location, facing the lake
6. Update equipment list with large zipties, smart camera traps, laptop for megatector, additional song meters, and other equipment needed for next time

## Notes
- no drone flights today, not enough people (2 field assistants, 1 supervisor); plus Dan overseeing safety and animal welfare
- need at least 1, ideally 2, more people to help with drone flights
- checking the sensors after 3 days a good interval, despite our best efforts there was 1 bioacoustic and 1 camera trap not configured correctly; our checks allowed us to catch this early and fix


### Improvements for megadetector pipeline
- useful to print out which images have >3 animals
- want list of images so we can quickly check mnaually which have animals
- useful to copy over photos with large count of animals for post-processing
- want high-level stats by folder for how many images have animals >3
- megadetector has a high recall (lots of false positives)
- delete folders with lots of false positives (like photos when camera traps was stored)
- battery level


### General comments
- large ziptie (36") much easier to install and more sturdy than the small ones
- it would be really nice to have a camera trap version of Song Meter - these are long-lasting, and its very nice that you don't need to remove the SD card to check the data and sensor status. Does such a camera trap exist? Need to chat with edge AI community - maybe ConservationXLabss
